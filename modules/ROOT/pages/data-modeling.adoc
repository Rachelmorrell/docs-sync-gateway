== Property prefix

User properties cannot begin with an underscore (`+_+`).

The underscore character (`+_+`) is a reserved prefix for system properties of a document (`+_id+`, `+_rev+` etc.)
A document which contains user properties with a leading underscore will be rejected by Sync Gateway with the following error.
